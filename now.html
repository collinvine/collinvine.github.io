      <div class="update">
        <p>After several months in the job market and with 4 good offers on the table, <span class="label--highlight">I
            took a job as a PM at YouTube</span> at the end of Feb.</p>
        <p>It's completely different from what I expected. Given the size of Google/YouTube, I was expecting the work to
          be narrow and—relative to my founder experience—boring. Yet, I expected the training and
          this-is-how-we-build-products to be world class. Neither is true. My scope and
          area of ownership is large which I love. However, I've been surprised to experience how immature the org
          is. At the time I joined, my team lacked many processes and standards that even the product org at my
          startups had. (I've since come to understand why, which is a mix of the product area I'm working in being new
          and growing like a weed, and a deliberate decentralized culture at Google.)</p>
        <p>Overall I'm enjoying it and it is a great place for me right now. I get
          to go deep into my craft of building products, get paid very well relatively to startup life, and experience
          new things amidst a great group of people. I do still want to get back to startups, but I'm comfortable with
          that being on a 3 to 5 year timeline. (Although this week I've really had the
          startup itch and noticed the first feeling of desire to get back out there.)</p>

      <div class="update">
        <p>At the end of September, <span class="label--highlight">I decided to leave Colony</span>, the company I
          co-founded, after 4.5 years. I probably have an entire post explaining why and how I came to that conclusion,
          but suffice it to say it was the right time for me to move forward.</p>
        <p><span class="label--highlight">My main focus now is coding</span>. For about 2-years, I’ve been learning to
          code part time. I’ve completed a <a
            href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Udacity nanodegree <span class="arrow">→</span></a>, built a
          chrome extension, and have done some other online courses and small side projects. Yet I have never felt like
          I had the depth that I wanted. Faced with an idea and a blank editor I struggled to really make much progress.
        </p>
        <p>That’s when I heard about <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            class="underline">Launch School <span class="arrow">→</span></a>. Their mastery-based pedagogy really spoke
          to me and, at the end of 2019, I decided to enroll. I’ve been working through that part-time, but now that I’m
          no longer at Colony, this is the main thing I’m focusing on. I’m still early on in their curriculum, but my
          comprehension is really strong and I’m feeling much more capable.</p>
        <p>I’m also in the job market for the first time in my adult life. My
          ideal role is as a director of product at a series B startup. My experience interviewing so far has been
          mixed. As someone who has only ever been a founder, I’m a fairly atypical candidate.</p>
        <p>I have a breadth of hands-on experience across ops and product, and depth as an owner / leader who’s spent
          10+ years growing people, teams, and companies. I’m a strong product-first generalist who’s comfortable asking
          questions, finding the right problems, and figuring things out in ambiguous environments. Yet I’m not as
          niched or vertically deep as many candidates applying to specific roles. I’ve seen this be both a pro and a
          con.</p>
        <p>One company that's valued my unique experience is Google. I passed
          through their hiring process and was approved by their hiring committee earlier this year. I’m currently in
          the team match / offer stage with them.</p>
        <p>I don’t know where I’ll end up next, or when it’ll happen, but I do feel excited to enter this next stage of
          my career.</p>
